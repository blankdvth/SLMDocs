# SLM Docs

This site provides documentation on various aspects of the SLM Discord. Primarily, this site targets **both** end-users and developers of the custom Discord bot, although it may end up including general guides as well.

This is an unofficial project that was created for the convenience and ease of access of information, an alternative to the previously scattered format (barebones documentation for users in the bot, developer documentation via wiki & README, etc.)
